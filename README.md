# Lox Language Adaptation

## About

This project is my first dedicated attempt into a creating a recursive descent
interpreted language. It is full of questionable design decisions.

## How to compile and run

This project is trivial to compile

Simply run
```
$ make
$ make clean
```
in the project's root directory and then run

```
$ ./interp <filename>
```

to run a source file.
